# DMLib (Doug Mead Library)
###(Under construction)

#Intro
In the meantime you can explore dmlib.core.js which brings everything together, DMElement.js which is the original wrapped DOMElement which the others inherit from, and other files (either works in progress or soon to be deprecated)

#dmlib core
dmlib.core.js contains a refined version of DMElement and OOP methods.

#index.html and testPage.html
Documentation that I am working on. Needs much refining (working copy). testPage.html is what I use to test features as I add them. It does not have much in terms of documentation, but is more accurate and updated.

#DMElement (old version)
The other files are mainly shortcuts to specific DMElements like: DMButton, DMImage, etc.
